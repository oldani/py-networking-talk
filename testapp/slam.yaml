# DynamoDB Plugin
# 
# This plugin provisions DynamoDB tables for each stage.
# 
# dynamodb_tables:
#   # a simple table with a single id key:
#   mytable:
#     attributes:
#       id: "S"
#     key: "id"
#     read_throughput: 1
#     write_throughput: 1
# 
#   # a more complex example:
#   mytable2:
#    attributes:
#      id: "S"
#      name: "S"
#      age: "N"
#    key: ["id", "name"]
#    read_throughput: 1
#    write_throughput: 1
#    local_secondary_indexes:
#      myindex:
#        key: ["id", "age"]
#        project:
#          - "name"
#    global_secondary_indexes:
#      myindex2:
#        key: ["age", "name"]
